# Secure API Access Manager

This project is an API key management service that allows mobile app developers to access third-party APIs securely. It utilizes encryption to prevent API key theft and ensure data security.

## Overview

This project was initially envisioned as a SaaS service. However, due to a lack of time, I've decided to make it open-source. You can leverage the project's core logic to build your own API management system that can run on a virtual server for a small fee.

## Installation

1. Clone the project's GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/afurgapil/api-key-manager.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd api-key-manager`
3. Create the table on your MySQL server by running the `database/db.sql` file.
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Check the `.env` file and define the necessary variables.
6. Review the `// TODO` lines in the code and make necessary adjustments.

## Logic

The project functions as a server that listens for API requests. Each user can create their own endpoint and define a key. This key can be used to transfer data bidirectionally. You need to use predefined PAI request templates like "GEMINI" to send API requests.

## Testing

Backend testing scenarios have been developed for the project. Test scenarios are located in the `test` folder. The "TS.csv" file explains the test scenarios, and the "RTM.csv" file specifies the test cases.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements. Your feedback is highly valued and contributes to the learning experience.
